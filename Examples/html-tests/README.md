## HTML tests
These are just a collection of random HTML files that we have used in testing with the command line interface along with the resultant PDF's.


They are mostly generated by pretty_html so are likely to have embedded images and embedded style sheets (the recommended way of generating HTML when making pdf's).

The page template style sheet however will always be linked and therefore it will be necessary to install the application if you wish to test these locally.
